## Description
TCompos is an open-source tool for compositional verification of timed automata. The tool, designed for timed safety properties, introduces a novel compositional framework that alleviates the limitations of the existing frameworks by leveraging both forward and backward analysis techniques, paving the way for more efficient verification of systems, and to verify properties of systems that were previously considered infeasible. The tool builds upon the tool TChecker by incorporating the new algorithm alongside the existing reachability algorithm, enabaling comparisons between them.
