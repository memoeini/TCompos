## Description
TCompos is an open-source tool for compositional verification of timed automata. The tool, designed for timed safety properties, introduces a novel compositional framework that alleviates the limitations of the existing frameworks by leveraging both forward and backward analysis techniques, paving the way for more efficient verification of systems, and to verify systems that were previously considered infeasible. The tool builds upon the tool TChecker by incorporating the new algorithm alongside the existing ones, enabaling comparisons to evaluate peformance, accuracy, and efficiency.

## Release
This is a work in progress, and the source code is still being updated in a local repository. Please check back later for the initial release (expected around December 2024).
