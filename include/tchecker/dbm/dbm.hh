 \brief DBMs and operations on DBMs
 \note A DBM is a symbolic representation for conjunctions of difference constraints like x-y#c with
 # either < or <=. This implementation uses DBMs to represent sets of clock valuations. We assume a
 special clock 0 that represents the value 0. A DBM of dimension dim hence has clock 0 and dim-1 actual
 clocks with indices 1 to dim-1.
 A DBM of dimension dim is represented as a dim*dim array of difference bounds tchecker::dbm::db_t.
 The difference bound #c in [i,j] encodes the constraint x_i - x_j # c. The difference bound in [i,j] for
 dbm of dimension dim is accessed with dbm[i*dim+j].
 A DBM can be seen as weighted graph where nodes are clocks (including 0) and for any two clocks x and y,
 the weigth of the edge x -> y is the difference bound #c of the constraint y - x #c in the DBM.
 A DBM is consistent if for every clock x, the bound for x - x is <=0, and if the bound for 0 - x is less-than
 or equal-to <=0 (i.e. clocks are positive or zero). Notice that consistent zones are not empty.
 A DBM is tight if for every constraint x - y # c, the bound #c is the shortest-path from y to x in the
 corresponding graph. Every non-empty DBM has a unique corresponding tight DBM. Empty DBMs have a negative
 cycle on some clock x. Hence they cannot be tightened: there is no shortest path from x to x.

 \note A DBM can only represent integer values, whereas constraints such as 0<x<1
 only admit non-integer valuations. The solution is thus to scale up dbm by some
 factor to enlarge constraints in such a way that they admit an integer solution
 (e.g. scale up by 2 yields 0<x<2 which admits 1 as an integer solution). The returned
 value is the scale factor applied to dbm in order to get an integer solution.
 Hence, the actual rational valuation consists in clock values in the DBM divided by
 the scale factor.
